# Sports-Analytics

My name is Adam Kovar and I am a dedicated sports analytics professional with a passion for leveraging data to enhance team performance and player development. With expertise in statistical analysis and data visualization, I provide actionable insights that drive strategic decision-making in the sports industry.

## Big Data Bowl
In the 2025 Big Data Bowl, I had the opportunity to analyze NFL player tracking data to uncover patterns and trends that could inform coaching strategies and player evaluations. My analysis focused on the separation between wide receivers and defensive backs, as I developed a tool and metric to translate that separation into actionable insights, helping defenses anticipate and prepare for the ball in flight. The full project notebook can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/adamkovariu/custom-coverage-lab).

## Class Projects
### Created my own metric for evaluating clutch performance of Quarterbacks for first five weeks of the 2025 NFL season.
Sprint Challenge 2: In this project, I created a metric to evaluate the clutch performance of quarterbacks during the first five weeks of the 2025 NFL season. By analyzing game situations and quarterback decisions, I provided insights into their performance under pressure. 

### Developed a win probability model for NFL games using historical data and in-game statistics.
Sprint Challenge 3: In this project, I developed a win probability model for NFL games using historical data and in-game statistics. This model predicts the likelihood of a team winning at any point during the game, offering valuable insights for coaches and analysts.

## Personal Projects
### Created a dashboard to visualize player availability and injury impact on team performance for the Green Bay Packers in the 2023 NFL season.
Green Bay Packers Injury Dashboard: In this personal project, I developed a Shiny dashboard in R to visualize player availability and the impact of injuries on team performance for the Green Bay Packers during the 2023 NFL season. This tool helps coaches and analysts understand how injuries affect team dynamics and performance. The player productivity grades were sourced from Pro Football Focus (PFF). The dashboard can be accessed [here](https://adamkovaranalyticsprojects.shinyapps.io/PackersAvailabilityShiny/).

### Papers I have co-authored on sports analytics topics
 Performance Differences Between College Football Transfers and Recruits: This paper examines the performance differences between college football players who transfer schools and those who are recruited directly out of high school. By analyzing various performance metrics, we provide insights into how transfers impact team dynamics and success. The paper and accompanying visualization can be accessed [here](https://adamkovar.weebly.com/college-football-transfer-portal-study.html).

A Different View of Statistical Efficiency for Volleyball Serve Reception: The Plus/Minus Statistic: In this paper, we explore a new perspective on evaluating statistical efficiency in volleyball serve reception using the Plus/Minus statistic. Our analysis provides a deeper understanding of player contributions and team performance in volleyball. The paper and accompanying visualization can be accessed [here](https://adamkovar.weebly.com/womens-college-volleyball.html).

## Other Projects
Ange Postecoglou's Tottenham Hotspur: In this project, I analyzed the lineup management and performance of Tottenham Hotspur under manager Ange Postecoglou. By examining the lineup decisions and tactical approaches, I provided insights into the team's strategies and effectiveness on the field. The analysis can be accessed [here](https://adamkovar.weebly.com/tottenham-analysis.html).

Effectively Purchasing Wins in the MLB: Using WAR as a performance measure, I compared players’ contributions against their salaries to calculate WAR per $100K. While stars like Shohei Ohtani deliver elite production at high cost, undervalued players such as Bobby Witt Jr. provide far greater efficiency, offering significantly better WAR per dollar spent. The analysis can be accessed [here](https://adamkovar.weebly.com/money-men-in-the-mlb.html).
